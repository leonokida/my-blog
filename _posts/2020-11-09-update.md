# Welcome to my blog

Hi, how are you doing?  
I have some things to tell you, that happened since my last post. The first one of them is that I am doing a research project at the university I study at about Xatkit! :)  
It is an open-source chatbot, available [here](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit/wiki/Build-Xatkit). I just started using it, so I don't have much to talk about it right now, but I'll definitely give you an update on it when I can! :D  
I am also currently working on two other projects at *PET Computação UFPR*. One of them is a game that uses machine learning and the other one is an intelligent map for the healthcare system of my city.  
Well, that's all I had to talk about today. Thanks for reading it and feel free to contact me if you want to! :)
