# Welcome to my blog

This is the first post on my blog, so I'm going to tell a bit about myself.  
I am a computer science student at the Federal University of Paraná (*Universidade Federal do Paraná - UFPR*), in Brazil. I don't have decided what I 
would like to work with in the future yet.  
I am a member of an educational program in my university called "*Programa de Educação Tutorial - PET*", where we do 
activities such as teaching others, spreading knowledge about computing, research and, obviously, programming 
and developing projects that are useful to society. I learn a lot as a member of this program.  
I love playing videogames and my favorite game is The Last of Us Part II. I also like watching shows and my
favorite one right now is The Boys.  
Thanks for reading this and feel free to contact me if you want to :)
