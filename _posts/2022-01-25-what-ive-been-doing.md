# Welcome to my blog

Hi, how are you doing?  
It's been a while since I wrote my last post here ðŸ˜… and I'm so sorry for it! Let me tell you about the things I did last year.  
First, I've been working on the two *Pet ComputaÃ§Ã£o UFPR* projects I talked about last year. Unfortunately, we weren't able to finish neither of them, but we're advancing towards it.  
I also worked a lot on the chatbot I talked about last post. I finished an initial version of it, which is available [here](https://biod.c3sl.ufpr.br/chatbot/admin). At the moment, it is only available in Portuguese.  
The chatbot I developed helps you to get information about Brazil. You can, for example, ask it how many cities are there in each Brazilian state. For more information on how to use it, please access the site.  
These past weeks, I've been updating my Github [repositories](https://github.com/leonokida). My favorite one is a series of audio filters that I developed for WAV files ðŸ˜€! I think they are very interesting.  
I also developed two different projects involving binary trees. I think that binary trees are one of the most useful data structures ever created.  
Well, that's all I got to talk about today! Thanks for reading it and please feel free to contact me if you want to! :)
