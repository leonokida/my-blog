# Welcome to my blog

Hi, how are you doing?  
Some things happened since my last post and I'd like to talk to you about it. The first one of them is that I am doing research at the university I study at about Xatkit! :)  
It is an open-source chatbot, available [here](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit/wiki/Build-Xatkit). I just started using it, so I don't have much to talk about it right now, but I'll definitely give you an update on it when I can! :D  
I am also currently working on two other projects at *PET Computação UFPR*. One of them is a game that uses a machine learning decision tree and the other one is an intelligent map for the healthcare system of my city. I'm working at the front-end of this second project, using react.js.  
Well, that's all I had to talk about today. Thanks for reading it and feel free to contact me if you want to! :)
